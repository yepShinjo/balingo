# Balingo

Balingo is a web application designed to help students learn Balinese and its corresponding "sor singgih basa." Inspired by Duolingo, a very famous language learning platform, Balingo stems from the necessity of having a fun and gamified platform where people can learn while earning points. The interactive user interface makes them feel like they are in a game.
